My name is Maciej Stępień and I'm a robotics software engineer with a passion for all things robotic. For nearly 10 years, I've been immersed in the world of robotics, both as a hobbyist and later as a professional in the field for over 3 years now.

Through my experience, I've developed a wide range of skills in software development, robot design, and control. My primary area of expertise is in SLAM algorithms, and I've worked on several projects in this area. However, I'm also generally interested in other problems in robotics, especially those related to general-purpose humanoid robots.

When I'm not working, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest robotics technology and advancements, experimenting with new ideas, and building robots in my spare time.
