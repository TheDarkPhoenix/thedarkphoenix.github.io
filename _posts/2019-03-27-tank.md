General-purpose mobile robot based on Raspberry Pi Zero.

{% include figure.html image="/pics/Czolg/front.jpg" width="600" height="800" %}

The robot can be teleoperated using a web browser, it works quite well in rough terrain:

Construction started with PCB:

The PCB was supposed to control the following components:
- 2 motors with encoders
- 3 servos
- SPI communication with Raspberry
- battery voltage measurements
- 2 LEDs (indicating low battery voltage and "power on")

As a power source I used a LiPol battery that was connected to 2 voltage converters: one for the microcontroller and one for servos.

Parts of the construction were 3D printed using

The robot was controlled through a web browser, I used [https://hackaday.io/project/25092-zerobot-raspberry-pi-zero-fpv-robot/log/97988-the-new-zerobot-pro](https://hackaday.io/project/25092-zerobot-raspberry-pi-zero-fpv-robot/log/97988-the-new-zerobot-pro "Code"), modified to work with my SPI communication.
