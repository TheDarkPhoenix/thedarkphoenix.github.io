I made the game as part of a project from Computer Science in Middle School. The idea of the game is based on Hill Climb Racing, a popular game at the time. The physics engine of the game is based on the Box2D library. The longer we drive, the more difficult hills we encounter, the higher-value coins we earn, and the rarer we find fuel. I also added engine sounds and music in this game.
