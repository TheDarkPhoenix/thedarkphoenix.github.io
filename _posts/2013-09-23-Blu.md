In this game you can drive the car on the hills collecting coins and fuel. Made in C++ using SFML and Box2D libraries.

I made this game as a part of an IT project in Middle School. The idea of the game is based on Hill Climb Racing, a popular game at the time. The physics engine of the game is based on the Box2D library. The longer we drive, the more difficult hills we encounter, the higher-value coins we earn, and the rarer we find fuel. I also added engine sounds and music to this game.
