A piece of software for the perspective display of points in 3D.

I wrote this program as part of a Computer Science lesson in High School. I implemented the loading of point clouds from a txt file. They are in the format of coordinates (X, Y, Z) and colors (R, G, B). I obtained the point clouds through stereo vision camera. It is also possible to display geometric shapes, such as a house. The whole thing was written in Pascal.
