EKF SLAM that I implemented during my work on Formula Student Driverless car. I used C++ and Eigen for matrix operations. It also includes a simple cone detector, which processes Lidar data with PCL and calculates the position of a cone. Detected cones are later used as observations for EKF SLAM. The whole thing was implemented as a ROS Node.
