A 2D racing game with a top-down view. Written in C++ using SFML and Box2D libraries.

This game was made as part of an IT project in Middle School. It allows you to race against opponents on various tracks.

By including information about the squares in the text file and reading the current position of the car, I created a form of artificial intelligence opponents. Opponents react to being on a specific square by turning, accelerating or braking. The entire driving and crash simulation is based on the Box2D library, which resulted in realistic interactions between cars.  

You can also create new tracks in a separate editor, which I also wrote as part of the project. The track is divided into squares of a certain type: straight, left turn, right turn, grass and finish line.
