A 2D racing game with a top-down view. Written in C++ using SFML and Box2D libraries.

This game was also made as part of a project in Computer Science. It allows us to race against opponents on various tracks. We can also create our own tracks in a separate editor, which I also wrote as part of the project. The track is divided into squares of a certain type: straight, left turn, right turn, grass and finish line.

By including information about the relevant squares in the text file and reading the current position of the car, I introduced a form of artificial intelligence against which we can race. Opponents react to being on a section of the track by turning, accelerating or braking, respectively. The entire driving and crash simulation is based on the Box2D library. Thanks to this, I was able to get realistic interactions between cars.
