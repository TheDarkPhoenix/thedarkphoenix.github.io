This game was also made as part of a project in Computer Science. It allows you to race against opponents on various tracks. You can also create you own tracks in a separate editor, which I also wrote as part of the project. The track is divided into squares of a certain type: straight, left turn, right turn, grass and finish line.

By including information about the squares in the text file and reading the current position of the car, I created a form of artificial intelligence opponents. Opponents react to being on a specific square by turning, accelerating or braking. The entire driving and crash simulation is based on the Box2D library, which resulted in realistic interactions between cars.
