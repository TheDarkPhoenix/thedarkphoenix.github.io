All games were created in C++ as part of the IT project in Middle School.

### Snake

In this game you collect dollars with a snake. There are 3 difficulty modes to choose from, with varying snake speeds and rewards for collecting points. A ranking of the best players is also available.

### Tic-tac-toe

I wrote the tic-tac-toe game based on an example in a C++ course I took - "Od Zera do Gier Kodera". It is designed for two players. It has a 3x3 format, and the field to place a mark is selected using appropriate numbers. The program then checks the arrangement of signs, which leads to a draw or victory for one of the players.

### Pong

A game designed for two players. Bounce the ball until one of the players lets it pass. The game goes on until a predetermined number of points.
