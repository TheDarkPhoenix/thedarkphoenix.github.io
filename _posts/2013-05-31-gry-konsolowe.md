Tic-tac-toe, Snake and Pong written in C ++ as part of the Computer Science project at the Middle School.

### Snake

A classic game where you collect dollars with a snake. There are 3 difficulty modes to choose from, in which the snake changes speed differently. According to the mode, the reward for collecting points is also bigger. A ranking of the best players is also available.

I wrote the game of tic-tac-toe based on an example in a C++ course I took - "Od Zera do Gier Kodera". It is designed for two players. It has a 3x3 format, the field to place a mark is selected by using the appropriate numbers. The program then checks the arrangement of signs, which leads to a draw or victory for one of the players.
