Roomac is a low-cost autonomous mobile manipulation robot. It consists of a differential drive mobile base and a 5-DoF manipulator with a gripper. The whole construction costed around 550$ and using this platform I was able to prepare a proof-of-concept application - bringing a bottle to the user. This project was described in detail in my [master's thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macstepien/macstepien.github.io/master/files/masters_thesis_maciej_stepien.pdf).
