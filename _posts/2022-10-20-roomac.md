Roomac is a low-cost autonomous general-purpose robot that consists of a differential drive mobile base and a 5-DoF manipulator with a gripper. The costs of the whole construction summed up to around 550$ and using this platform I was able to create a proof-of-concept application - fetching a bottle to the user. This project was described in more detail in my [master's thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/macstepien/macstepien.github.io/master/files/masters_thesis_maciej_stepien.pdf).

The robot was designed in Fusion 360, most of the construction was 3D printed. The base consists of DC drill motors, encoders, IMU and STM32BluePill MCU. In the manipulator there are 6 servos: 3 XYZrobot A1-16 and 3 cheaper TowerPro (MG996R and 2xSG-92R) which are controlled by the second STM32BluePill. To detect obstacles and create a map of the environment I used Kinect (the one from Xbox360). The second Kinect was mounted above the table and it is used for the manipulation (robot’s position is detected using ARTags). Navigation computations are run on the laptop placed in the base of the robot.

Software is based on ROS Melodic, I used many ROS packages, some of them are [RTABMap](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/), [move base](http://wiki.ros.org/move_base) (with [TEB](http://wiki.ros.org/teb_local_planner) as a local planner), [robot localization](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html), [MoveIt](https://moveit.ros.org/) with [BioIKKinematics](https://github.com/TAMS-Group/bio_ik.git) (robot’s arm has 5DoF and only with BioIK I was able to achieve desired positions), [ARTrackAlvar](http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar). Working with cheap mechanical components was quite challenging control-wise, but in the end, I was able to achieve smooth performance.

Apart from construction I also created a simulation of the robot in the Gazebo. There is a docker image with it, so executing the demo is really easy (basically you only need to copy and paste two commands). For further details please refer to the instruction in the README on Github.
